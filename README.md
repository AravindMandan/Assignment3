**Explanation of how conflicts are resolved**


Identify the Conflict: When you try to merge branches, GitHub will notify you if there are conflicts. These conflicts occur when changes in different branches overlap.

Open the Conflict Editor: You can resolve simple conflicts directly on GitHub using the conflict editor. Navigate to the pull request with the conflict and click on "Resolve conflicts" 1.

Choose Changes to Keep: In the conflict editor, you'll see the conflicting changes marked with <<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>>. Decide whether to keep changes from your branch, the other branch, or a combination of both1.

Edit and Save: Remove the conflict markers and make the necessary changes. Once you've resolved all conflicts, click "Mark as resolved" and then "Commit merge"
